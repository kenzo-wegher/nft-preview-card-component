## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass / SCSS


### Continued development

I've tried to get as close as I could to the original box-shadow.
Likewise, I've tried for a long time to get the same effect on the nft-image:hover, but I couldn't get the same level of brightness of the eye-image's white.
